**I’m an IT Professional and Photographer based in the beautiful mountains of Eastern Kentucky.**

With more than two decades experience in the tech world and a lifelong passion for photography, I enjoy bringing creativity and curiosity into everything I do. When I’m not working, you’ll usually find me spending time with my wife, Jasmine, our six kids, and our two grandkids.

As Cloud Engineer for Millennial Specialty Insurance, I’m passionate about solving complex infrastructure challenges, streamlining cloud operations, and driving continuous improvements in performance, security, and scalability.
